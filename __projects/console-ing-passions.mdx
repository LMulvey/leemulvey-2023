# Overview

The Console-ing Passions conference was founded in 1989 by a group of feminist media scholars and artists looking to create a space to present work and foster feminist scholarship on issues of television, culture, and identity. The organizers reached out to me to create and maintain an informational website for the 2023 conference.

# The Stack ðŸ’¾

To keep things easy to maintain and quick to update, I opted to use Next.js 13, React, and Typescript. This made the stack incredibly flexible and quick to iterate on as we didn't have time to implement a CMS system - all changes were managed by myself. The site was accessible, responsive,
and easy to navigate on all devices.
