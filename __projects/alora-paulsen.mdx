# Overview

As Alora neared completion of her PhD in 2024, she required a concise and professional website to display her accomplishments during her tenure - somewhere that could easily be referenced throughout her job search. With incredible branding by MikaÃ«l Neves, we built a simplistic but functional website that served the purposes required!

# The Stack ðŸ’¾

This project gave me further reason to continue building with Next.js 15 and Tailwind. I was able to quickly design and make changes without worrying too much about the architecture of things. Next.js also enabled me to extremely rapidly create a Contact form using Server Actions and the help of Resend.
