# Overview

I made this to mess around with the React Hooks API and totally not to cheat at Scrabble with my wife to feel better about myself.

# What is it?

It's a React application that takes in an input of letters (the ones you, the player currently has) and outputs all possible word options based on the letters you have. It's a simple concept but it was a fun way to explore the new React Hooks API and see how it could be used in a real-world scenario.
