# Overview

if-me.org is an open source project built and maintained entirely by volunteers. The platform is a mental health community designed to make it easy to share personal stories with trusted allies and prides itself on being a safe space to share, grow, and learn to live with mental illness.

# How'd I help?

I originally began supporting [if-me.org](https://if-me.org) during 2019 Hacktoberfest. I was drawn to the project because of its mission and the fact that it was built with Ruby on Rails, a technology I was interested in learning more about.
